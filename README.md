  In this repository you will find a Python program that looks for all the published products of any seller in Mercado Libre's site, based on a specific Seller ID and Site ID. It includes user documentation and a sample output with the following label: "seller_179571326_MLA.txt".

  Feel free to do any suggestions or improvementes, I am just at the beginning of my journey into the IT world.
