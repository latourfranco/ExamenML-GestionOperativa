​	This little Python program I made myself is quite easy to use. You just have to modify the content of two variables: **sellerID** and **siteID**. As their names indicate, the first one stores an integer value that represents the ID of any person that has published at least one product in MercadoLibre's site, and the second one corresponds to a string that sets in which country you want to look for your candidate's posts.

​	The following piece of code shows an example set of these two variables' content:

~~~python
sellerID = 179571326
siteID = "MLA"
~~~
